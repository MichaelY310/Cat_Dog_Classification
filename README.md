# Cat_Dog_Classification
A pytorch program that can classify pictures of cats and dogs

# training
Put your dataset (pictures only, named "cat001" or "dog001") in the "train" directory. Run "resize_pictures.py" to resize the pictures. Run "CNN_train.py" or "Resnet_train.py" to train and save your model. 

# classification
Edit "demo.py" and select a model ("CNNmodel01.pth" or "Resnetmodel01.pth") and a picture. Remember to put the picture in the "test" directory.
